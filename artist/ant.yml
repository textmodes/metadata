biography: |-
  Anthony Schiller is a graphic designer / artist born in Muskegon, MI.
  Born and raised an 80's child, he grew up reading comic books,
  skateboarding, listening to punk music while participating in the late
  80's early 90's BBS scene, which lead to his introduction of ANSI and
  ASCII art. Known locally in the 616 area code as ANT, his talent was
  uncontained, later moving on to RIP graphics and early bitmaps.
  Originally working in tedious to use programs like MS-paint and than
  finally delving into gimp, and than photoshop.

  Now after a few years
  of living in the real world, I'm back to what was my original calling.
  As I went from job to job, design would always peek it's head out at
  me, and I would be the one in charge of making new signs for the
  store, or setting up some kind of advertisement, or fixing something
  on the website, I would always volunteer my services and succeed with
  flying colors.

  In 2008 I decided to go back to school; so I chose to
  go back to Baker College for Culinary Arts. After Almost 2 years of
  that, I decided that it was something that wasn't really for me. I
  like to cook, but not in a restaurant setting. In 2010 after looking
  into the Graphic Design program at Baker, I decided to give graphics
  design a try. Now here we are in 2013, after some additional time
  (after being sick, and having some of my classes not line up
  correctly) I have finally finished college.

  I have had an interesting
  time getting to where I am in life. Lot's of hard work, trials and
  tribulations. Nothing has come easy; everything that I have ever
  wanted has taken a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. I am focused, and
  driven to get things done.
