about: |-
  Superior Art Creations, often referred to as SAC, is an underground
  artscene group which caters primarily to and is well known within the
  warez scene. SAC originated as a German-based art group, founded in
  December of 1994 by six members: @Dream.Design, @Kaethe, @Raiser,
  @Toxic.Trancer and the two legendary artists @Hetero and @Roy, with
  @Roy acting as the primary organizer of the group.

  During the mid to
  late nineties most of the notable ANSI artscene groups had distanced
  themselves from the warez scene, rather creating art for the sake of
  art, or for bulletin boards that were purely artscene related. Seizing
  this opportunity, SAC moved into this vacant territory and quickly
  became recognized as the leading group of warez scene artists. Towards
  the late 1990s, a good majority of NFO file ASCII art was created by
  various members of SAC. In 1999, lead ASCII artist @Ferrex ascended
  into the role of senior staff and leader, continuing to control the
  group to this day.

  Now a globally operating organization, SAC employs
  approximately 40 artists and programmers worldwide and continues to be
  one of the leading groups creating art for the warez scene.
