about: |-
  ACiD Productions was originally founded in 1990 as ANSI Creators in
  Demand by five members: @RaD.Man, @Shadow.Demon, @Grimm, @The.Beholder
  and @Phantom. Their work originally concentrated in ANSI and ASCII
  art, but the group later branched out into other artistic media such
  as music tracking, demo coding, and multimedia software development
  (e.g. image viewers).

  In the mid-1990s, ACiD created subsidiary
  groups responsible for these broader areas. For example, #Remorse.1981
  is the official ACiD sub-label responsible for ASCII art and other
  text-based graphics. Similarly, pHluid is responsible for module
  tracking and music production.
