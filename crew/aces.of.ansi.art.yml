about: |-
  Aces of ANSI Art, <A.A.A> or <AAA>, were the first organized body of
  artists formed for the sole purpose of creating ANSI art. The group
  was founded by two Californians, @Zyphril and @Chips.Ahoy, and
  operated from 1989 to 1991. In 1990, a small number of key members
  splintered from Aces to form the group now known as #ACiD.Productions.
