  Remorse was established in late 1994 by two IBM-PC scene ASCII artists
  from San Jose, California who went by the pseudonyms @Necromancer and
  @Necronite.

  While text-based art in a general sense is nothing new to
  speak of, Remorse is considered to be one of the earliest organized
  bodies created solely for creating ASCII art, second only to
  #Katharsis In that respect, #Katharsis was to ASCII what
  #Aces.of.ANSI.Art (AAA) was to ANSI, so one could argue that Remorse
  is the ACiD of ASCII.

  After releasing five (5) artpacks between
  1994-1995, Remorse temporarily disbanded. Prominent members each went
  their separate ways; some created their own groups (such as #Trank)
  and another joined ANSI Creators in Demand to assist with their ASCII
  division.

  In 1996, it was decided by the leaders of #Trank, ACiD
  proper, and the newly formed #ACiD!ASCII division (not yet named
  Remorse) that they should consolidate (and in some ways reunite) as a
  single group. Like pHluid, the music sublabel of ACiD, the leaders of
  these three organizations merged together under the new name of
  Remorse/#ACiD!ASCII, and became an official extension of
  #ACiD.Productions. This is the Remorse which continues to exist to
  this day (1996-2005).
