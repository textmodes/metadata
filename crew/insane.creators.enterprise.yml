  expanded title is rarely ever used, iCE is an acronym for Insane
  Creators Enterprise, founded by French Canadian member @Many.Axe
  (later known as @Frozen.Tormentor). The group originally specialized
  in the creation of ANSI artwork for BBSes and MCGA graphics. During
  the BBS-era, their biggest competitor was a group called
