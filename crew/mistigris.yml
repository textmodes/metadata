about: |-
  Mistigris (pronounced "misty-gree") was an artscene group founded in
  late 1994 by @Cthulu of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

  The group primarily operated out of BBSes within the city's area code of 604
  (with a significant outpost in Quebec's 418 area code) joined across suburbs
  and provinces by the group's echomail network known as KiTSCHNet. In addition
  to numerous music disks and issues of their house diskmag KiTHE, among other
  one-off projects, Mistigris released thirty-five artpacks between October
  1994 and June 1998.

  The group emerged to fill a vacuum left by the collapse of local supergroup
  !iMPERiAL in September 1994, immediately striving against the similar efforts
  of competing local groups !RAiD and !Wild.Buffalo.Tamerz (WBT). While these
  competitors ceased operations in fairly short order, in !RAiD the foundations
  were laid for the January 1995 founding of ANSI-only supergroup !Integrity --
  an immensely popular project which would serve to be an ongoing slow leak
  deflating MiST of its upper-level ANSI artists, leaving it primarily known
  for its specialty focus on tracked music and "lit", mediums generally
  overlooked or passed over by the artscene's text-graphics enthusiasts but
  leading Mistigris to its highest achievements in domination of the 1997
  "!Blender" IRC competitions.

  In an attempt to address the rash of defections to !Integrity, Mistigris
  experienced a tentative, abortive and ultimately unsuccessful merger with
  American group !FiRE in March of 1995, and later a far more successful
  wholesale incorporation of local group !kRAP. Mist's history was also rife
  with borrowings from postings and material created by members of the local
  TABNet (The Adopted Bastards Network) community.

  Thinking outside of the box, in 1997 Mistigris engaged in what they called
  the "Mistigris World Tour", where instead of releasing their members' art
  within their own packs, the artists released en masse in other groups as a
  virtual tour of sorts. Groups who cooperated in this tour concept included
  !Blade, !Fire, !Dark and !Fistful.of.Steel (FOS). @Cthulu had plans to tour
  with several smaller groups as well (!Ophidiac, !TeklordZ), to help mutually
  raise each others' profiles, but as he put it, "the groups kept dying" before
  tour arrangements could be finalized.

  Mistigris itself ultimately came to a close in mid-1998 due to numerous
  factors, among them mass graduation by its membership from high school into a
  world of distractions, disagreements between department heads regarding
  quality control, and an ongoing inability to retain the membership of its
  most talented active textmode artists.  Proving most lethal, however, was the
  undermining and final collapse of the 604 area code's bizarrely long-lived
  BBS scene due to the new local availability of affordable dial-up internet
  access â€” when Mist's first world headquarters The Screaming Tomato BBS (TST)
  went down, it was replaced in short order by The Jade Monkey (TJM), but when
  TJM went offline there was no longer anywhere relevant for the local members
  to call in to.

  In its wake several former stalwart Mistigris members soldiered on as
  @Hallucigenia; @Cthulu, seeking a real-world equivalent to the dynamic and
  creative artscene, began working for The Living Closet, lurking at the
  Vancouver Poetry Slam, and started a long career in event production.
