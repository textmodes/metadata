about: |-
  Impure ASCII, also known as Impure ASCII 1940 is an ASCII art group
  founded in January of 1998 by two artists from Canada who went by the
  pseudonyms The Genocidal Servant (nicknamed @tEEGE and formerly known
  as @Incesticide) and @Helter.Skelter. The five original members of the
  group were @Dark.Stalker, @Helter.Skelter, @Mystic.Rage, @Shypht and
  The Genocidal Servant.

  Impure was a result of a merger between
  Canadian ANSI art group #Gel and the ASCII art division of Norwegian /
  American group #WOE.Productions (also known as WOE!ASCII). Shortly
  after its formation, the majority of the Canadian members, including
  the leader, abandoned the group leaving Impure without direction. The
  founder of WOE, @pOGUE, met up with @xZiP (a.k.a. @Hellbeard) and took
  over the responsibilities of the group.
